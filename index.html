            <!-- Placeholder -->
            <p>Hi, I’m Patrick Kuprewicz. I’m currently a student at Colby College, and before this, I attended Glenbrook South High School. During high school, I was not only a student but also a committed athlete. I particularly loved track and field, and I ran in both high and low hurdles.
                Apart from athletics, I’ve always been into engineering and creating things. One of my favorite projects was a helmet ventilation system I designed to make wearing helmets more comfortable, and safe during intense activities. I also participated in SkillsUSA competitions, which helped me hone my technical skills and fuel my passion for innovation.
                At Colby, I’m continuing to pursue both my academic interests in engineering and my love for athletics. It’s all about combining the technical and the physical for me, and I’m excited to see where this journey takes me next.</p>
